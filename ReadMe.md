## About 
A vet management app for veterinary practice to help them manage their animals and vets. The user can assign multiple animals to a vet, but an animal can only be registered with one vet. The user is able to register new animals, look at their details, update the details and delete animals if necessary.

# Possible Extensions
* Mark owners as being registered/unregistered with the Vet. unregistered owners won't be able to add any more animals.
* If an owner has multiple animals we don't want to keep updating contact details separately for each pet. Extend your application to reflect that an owner can have many pets and to more sensibly keep track of owners' details (avoiding repetition / inconsistencies)
* Handle check-in / check-out dates
* Let the practice see all animals currently in the practice (today's date is between the check-in and check-out?)
* Sometimes an owner does not know the DOB. Allow them to enter an age instead. Try and make sure this always up to date - ie if they visit again a year from now a 3 yr old dog is now 4.
* Add extra functionality of your choosing - assigning treatments, a more comprehensive way of maintaining treatment notes over time. Appointments. Pricing / billing.
